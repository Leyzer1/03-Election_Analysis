# Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this anaylis to find the elections's winner by total vote count and percentage. The anaylis will also list the candidates names and the total number votes received for each. It also finds the largest voter count by county and percentage of total. This anaylis was created by using Python as the main anaylis tool, in which we were able to read the data from a csv file and then write the results in a new csv text file.

 # Election-Audit Summary
 This python code can be easily modified to fit other types of elections. This code can be used to analyze more counties and and more candidates. It can also be used to count a presidential election in which instead of counties we can count the votes by state. If this is the case the code can also be modified to gather electoral votes per state and calculate the winner with that dataset. In brief the hard work of writing this code is done, it only takes knowing where it can be used and how to change the variables if needed.
